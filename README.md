# Kernelization in Machine Learning

This project explores **Kernelization in Machine Learning**, focusing on the mathematical foundations of kernel functions and demonstrating their application in handling non-linear data through Support Vector Machines (SVM). 

## Overview

Kernel methods allow machine learning models to work in non-linear spaces, enhancing their ability to separate complex data. This project covers:
- Theory: Kernel functions, the kernel trick, and popular kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF).
- Application: Using kernelized SVMs to classify non-linear data.
- Visualization: Decision boundaries generated by different kernels.

## Repository Structure

- `kernelization_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with theory, code, and visualizations.
